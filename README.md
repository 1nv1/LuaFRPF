This script works on Lua and LuaJIT, it contains a Get_Config() function. The idea is get the same method of configuration like many software on Unixes with a text file.

 This function return a table, every index of table is the configuration parameter. If you run with the next test config file:

```
# Example 
trys        =  111111    # This is a numeric configuration
pi          =  3.14 
chain       =  "Hello world!"
bad = Hello world!"     # This configuration is't valid. 
bad2 = 12c              # The error is mix numbers and not valid text
bad3 = Hello world!     # The " token is not present
# End of example
```

With:

```Lua
t = Get_Config ("test.cnf")
for k, v in pairs (t) do print(k, v) end
```

You get:

```
trys    111111
pi      3.14
chain   Hello world!
```
